      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am 24 years old, born and raised in California. I have recently started my journey into the software
        engineering world. I am excited and eager to learn, although I have found out very quickly that it is not a
        walk in the park. I've worked in many fields over the years, but I have always been consistent about
        making music.
